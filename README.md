# ✈️ Airport Flight Delay Analysis 
A complete data analysis project using SQL for data extraction and Excel for visualization, aimed at uncovering patterns and performance trends related to flight delays across airlines, airports, days of the week, and routes.

🛠️ **Tools Used**
SQL: For data querying and analysis
Excel: For data visualization (bar charts, column graphs, tables)
Canva: For designing the project presentation layout

🗂 **Dataset Overview**
Column	      Description
Carrier	      Airline Code
DepDelay	    Departure Delay in Minutes
ArrDelay	    Arrival Delay in Minutes
Origin, Dest	Departure and Arrival Airports
DayOfWeek	    Numeric Day of Week (1 = Monday)


📊 **Quick Stats**
Total Flights Analyzed: 28,738
Average Departure Delay: 8.59 minutes
Average Arrival Delay: 4.00 minutes
Worst Delay Day: Thursday (Avg: 28.97 minutes)

✅ **Recommendations**
Improve infrastructure and capacity at top delay-prone airports
Optimize airline schedules, especially for mid-week congestion
Investigate weather-driven delays in major cities
Increase monitoring and traffic control on high-traffic routes

📌 **Conclusion**
By combining SQL-based querying with Excel-based visualization, this project offers a powerful look at U.S. flight delay trends. The insights can help:
Airlines improve scheduling
Airports better manage traffic flow
Passengers make smarter travel decisions
